# Escape Room Utilities #

Have you ever been to an escape room and been disappointed by the lack of immersion? Have you ever been stuck on a puzzle and unable to get hints? From now on, you'll never have to be confused or unhappy in an escape room again!

Introducing the **wenBox Escape Support Technology**.

With the wenBox, you can easily generate escape room concepts and provide adequate support for players.

The wenBox contains two main modules: the software for generating an escape room story, and the hardware for immersively guiding players through their escape.

## Story Generation ##
Usually escape rooms are a one-time experience. Once you solve a room, it isn't much fun to solve it again. With wenBox tools, escape room managers are able to modularize their escape room stories and puzzles based on the available resources. The tool takes in a few parameters (theme, physical requirements, number of players, time limit, difficulty), and develops a story that conforms to the inputs. We used **Groq AI acceleration servers** to instantly generate Llama output, and **BoundaryML** to clean the LLM output and seamlessly integrate it with our hardware. Using the wenBox tool, you can easily transform a repetitive escape room into a brand new experience every time.

## Hardware AI Companion ##
Now that you've generated a new scenario, you need some way to guide players through the new room. The wenBox reads the scenario and talks the players through the escape situation. To personalize the guidance, the wenBox allows the players to interact with it naturally using **Cartesia AI's** natural speech processing abilities - the player can ask questions and talk to the wenBox like a human tour guide. Additionally, the wenBox contains sensors and tools to extend the puzzle possibilities. The wenBox can connect to puzzles and receive data to track the players' progress and accurately go through the escape scenario. The wenBox ensures the novelty and enjoyment of any escape room by instantly adapting to any new scenario and increasing the puzzle options.
