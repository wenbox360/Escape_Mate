# EscapeMate: Escape Room Utilities

Have you ever been to an escape room and felt disappointed by the lack of immersion? Have you ever found yourself stuck on a puzzle without any hints? With EscapeMate, those days are over!
Introducing EscapeMate Escape Support Technology

EscapeMate makes it easy to create captivating escape room concepts while providing essential support for players.

## Story Generation

Escape rooms are often a one-time experience. Once you solve a room, replaying it loses its thrill. With EscapeMate, escape room managers can modularize their stories and puzzles based on available resources. Input a few parameters (theme, physical requirements, number of players, time limit, difficulty), and watch as the tool generates a tailored story. Utilizing Groq AI acceleration servers for instant output and BoundaryML for seamless integration, EscapeMate transforms repetitive experiences into fresh adventures every time.

## Hardware AI Companion

Once you've crafted a new scenario, you need a way to guide players through the experience. EscapeMate reads the scenario and navigates players through the escape challenge. With Cartesia AI's natural speech processing, players can interact with EscapeMate as they would with a human tour guide, asking questions and receiving personalized guidance. The device also features sensors and tools that enhance puzzle possibilities, allowing it to connect to puzzles, track progress, and adapt to new scenarios. EscapeMate ensures that every escape room experience is unique and engaging.
