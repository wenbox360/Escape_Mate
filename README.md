# Escape Room Utilities #

Have you ever been to an escape room and been disappointed by the lack of immersion? Have you ever been stuck on a puzzle and unable to get hints? From now on, you'll never have to be confused or unhappy in an escape room again!

Introducing the **wenBox Escape Support Technology**.

With the wenBox, you can easily generate escape room concepts and provide adequate support for players.

The wenBox contains two main modules: the software for generating an escape room story, and the hardware for immersively guiding players through their escape.

## Story Generation ##
Usually escape rooms are a one-time experience. Once you solve a room, it isn't much fun to solve it again. With wenBox tools, escape room managers are able to modularize their escape room stories and puzzles based on the available resources. The tool takes in a few parameters (theme, physical requirements, number of players, time limit, difficulty), and develops a story that conforms to the inputs. Using the wenBox tool, you can easily transform a repetitive escape room into a brand new experience every time.
