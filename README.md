# EscapeMate: Escape Room Utilities

Have you ever been to an escape room and felt disappointed by the lack of immersion? Have you ever found yourself stuck on a puzzle without any hints? With EscapeMate, those days are over!
Introducing EscapeMate Escape Support Technology

EscapeMate makes it easy to create captivating escape room concepts while providing essential support for players.

This is our submission to MHacks 2024; EscapeMate won the Interactive Media and Game Design contest category.

## Story Generation

Escape rooms are often a one-time experience. Once you solve a room, replaying it loses its thrill. With EscapeMate, escape room managers can modularize their stories and puzzles based on available resources. Input a few parameters (theme, physical requirements, number of players, time limit, difficulty), and watch as the tool generates a tailored story. Utilizing Groq AI acceleration servers for instant output and BoundaryML for seamless integration, EscapeMate transforms repetitive experiences into fresh adventures every time.

We built a simple and easy to use UI for quick story generation.

## Hardware AI Companion

Once you've crafted a new scenario, you need a way to guide players through the experience. EscapeMate reads the scenario and navigates players through the escape challenge. With Cartesia AI's natural speech processing, players can interact with EscapeMate as they would with a human tour guide, asking questions and receiving personalized guidance. The device also features sensors and tools that enhance puzzle possibilities, allowing it to connect to puzzles, track progress, and adapt to new scenarios. EscapeMate ensures that every escape room experience is unique and engaging.

Our hardware, pictured below, allows players to have questions answered in real time and interfaces directly with escape room puzzles for a more personal touch.

## Demo
We built a demo puzzle so that judges and potential users could physically test and experience the EscapeMate system. We kept the puzzle easy to accomodate the judges' time - solving the puzzle would cause the escape room scenario to progress.

The puzzle was essentially an electronic combination lock. Entering 1111 would send the unlock message and prompt the success message.
